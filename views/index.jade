        p If we had it our way, all of us would be on a pontoon gambling boat this weekend with Dark and Stormy's in hand, setting sail for 80 degree weather. Since our parent's have been patiently waiting for a ceremony though, we decided June nuptials on the edge of the world (Montauk feels like earth's end, no?) would suffice. There are plenty of wish lanterns to be lit and bottles of champagne waiting to be popped - all we need are your lovely faces.

      p We appreciate you coming from far and wide - city friends, we know that traveling the L.I.E feels like crossing the country - to be with us this summer. Your attendance is as good a gift as any. Who really needs a Vitamix, anyhow? (However, in the event you find it necessary, they are available at Williams Sonoma).
      p If you feel inclined to add a little shimmer to our otherwise dull china collection, you can browse our `wants' over here at Potterybarn. To better dress our guest bedroom, possibly in anticipation of your next long weekend in the city, visit Juliska Home.
