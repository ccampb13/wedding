  p My wonderful matron-of-honor and sister-in-law, whom I'm also fortunate to call one of my best friends. Kim moved to NYC as I was leaving, so I was thrilled when she and Sam decided to move to Nashville in 2012. 
  p They currently live just a few miles from us, and when she's not assembling the best cheese plates or spinning tunes, Kim's busy working on children's books.
