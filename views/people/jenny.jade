  p One of three bridesmaids whom I met at Washington and Lee University, where we roomed together for three years and tag-teamed many a costume party. Here, we are at our sorority's "Famous Lovers" party, dressed as Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. Obviously. 
  p Jenny is an avid advocate of bikeable and walkable neighborhoods, and is currently in grad school in Denver, studying urban planning. I'm hoping she has a plan for Nashville.
