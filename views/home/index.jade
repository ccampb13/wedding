        p.other  Unfortunately, the State Legislature killed funding for Nashville's first shot at reliable, rapid mass transit earlier this year. The city has a Metro bus system that will get you around, but busses are very few and far between on the weekends. Regular fare is $1.70. 
        p.other A free green bus connects the Gulch (where our hotels are) to downtown and Germantown, and is much more reliable on weekends. Check out that map route here. 
        p.other Because parking is a hassle, we recommend using Uber, Lyft, or good ole fashioned taxis to get around the city this weekend. We will provide transportation from the hotel, to our ceremony and reception, with staggered departure times throughout the night. 
        p.other We will update the website with transportation and hotel details as we get closer to August 8.

          p We know many of you have traveled long distance to be with us on our wedding day, and your attendance is as good a gift as any. If you feel inclined to help us achieve culinary greatness or add some pizazz to the guest room (for when you come visit, of course), we are registered at Williams-Sonoma and West Elm.
