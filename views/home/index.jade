          h3 Welcome to our wedding website! We are counting down the days till August 8 and we can't wait to celebrate with you in Nashville. We'll update this site with info on lodging, travel and details on where you need to be and when as we get closer to the big day. But for now, know that champagne and dancing are waiting at the end.

          h5 EJ
          p I moved to Nashville from Washington D.C. in 2010, expecting to stay for one year, before hightailing it back north, home to New York. One year turned into two, and around then, I met Chad. Needless to say, two has turned in very nearly five years in Music City. I feel so lucky to have met and be marrying Chad, who delivers the best one-liners and smokes a mean rack of ribs. Fair warning, he's also pretty proud of his dance moves.

          h5 Our Relationship
          p Like most Nashville love stories, ours involves a honky tonk, beer and country music. We met through mutual friends at a birthday party at a bar that we have been back to exactly twice since. (But you should check it out. It's called "Losers," and despite the name, is quite lucky and fun). Chad proposed at home in July 2014, EJ said yes, and George, our hound dog, was beside himself. We celebrated under twinkly lights with Two Boots Pizza and champagne.

        p We know many of you have traveled long distance to be with us on our wedding day, and your attendance is as good a gift as any. If you feel inclined to help us achieve culinary greatness or add some pizazz to the guest room (for when you come visit, of course), we are registered at West Elm and Williams-Sonoma.
