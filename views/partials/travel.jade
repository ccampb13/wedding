    p.other  Unfortunately, the State Legislature killed funding for Nashville's first shot at reliable, rapid mass transit earlier this year. The city has a Metro bus system that will get you around, but busses are very few and far between on the weekends. Regular fare is $1.70. 
    p.other A free, bright green bus called the Music City Circuit connects The Gulch (where one of our hotels is located) to downtown Nashville and Germantown, and is much more reliable on weekends. Check out that route and schedule&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.nashvillemta.org/Nashville-MTA-Music-City-Circuit.asp' target='_blank') here.
    p.other Because parking is a hassle, we recommend using Uber, Lyft, or good ole fashioned taxis to get around the city this weekend. We will provide transportation from the hotel, to our ceremony and reception, with staggered departure times throughout the night. If you plan to drive yourself, please note that our 
      a(href='http://www.houstonstationnashville.com/parking/', target='_blank') venue 
      | requires valet parking for all event guests.
    p.other We will update the website with transportation and hotel details as we get closer to August 8.

      p Nashville also has plenty of AirBnb and Homeaway rentals, which are perfect for groups. We recommend looking in the neighborhoods of Downtown, Midtown, Vandy/West End, 12South, Germantown, and East Nashville (5 Points, Inglewood) if youâ€™d like to consider this option.
