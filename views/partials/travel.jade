    p.other  Unfortunately, Nashville doesn't have reliable, rapid mass transit. The city has a Metro bus system that will get you around, but busses are very few and far between on the weekends. Regular fare is $1.70. 
    p.other A free, bright green bus called the Music City Circuit connects The Gulch (where one of our hotels is located) to downtown Nashville and Germantown, and is much more reliable on weekends. Check out that route and schedule&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.nashvillemta.org/Nashville-MTA-Music-City-Circuit.asp' target='_blank') here.
    p.other Because parking is a hassle, we recommend using Uber, Lyft, or good ole fashioned taxis to get around the city this weekend. We will provide transportation from the hotel, to our ceremony and reception, with staggered departure times throughout the night. If you plan to drive yourself, please note that our 
      a(href='http://www.houstonstationnashville.com/parking/', target='_blank') venue 
      | requires valet parking for all event guests. As long as you pick up your keys from valet, you can leave your car there overnight.
    p.other For out-of-town guests, we will have a shuttle running between hotels, our church and to the reception venue, with staggered departure times back home. 
    p.other The shuttle will pick-up guests from the Fairfield Inn and Suites at 4:30 PM. Please meet in the lobby to board the bus. The shuttle will go straight to The Hermitage Hotel to pick up guests at 4:45 PM. Again, please be in the lobby ready to board the bus at that time. 
    P.other The shuttle will make trips from our church to the reception venue, with staggered departures to downtown area starting at 9.

      p Nashville also has plenty of AirBnb and Homeaway rentals, which are perfect for groups. We recommend looking in the neighborhoods of Downtown, Midtown, Vandy/West End, 12South, Germantown, and East Nashville (5 Points, Inglewood) if youâ€™d like to consider this option.
